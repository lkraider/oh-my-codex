# Ralplan (Consensus Planning Alias)

Ralplan is a shorthand alias for `$plan --consensus`. It triggers iterative planning with Planner, Architect, and Critic agents until consensus is reached, with **RALPLAN-DR structured deliberation** (short mode by default, deliberate mode for high-risk work).

## Usage

```
$ralplan "task description"
```

## Flags

- `--interactive`: Enables user prompts at key decision points (draft review in step 2 and final approval in step 6). Without this flag the workflow runs fully automated — Planner → Architect → Critic loop — and outputs the final plan without asking for confirmation.
- `--deliberate`: Forces deliberate mode for high-risk work. Adds pre-mortem (3 scenarios) and expanded test planning (unit/integration/e2e/observability). Without this flag, deliberate mode can still auto-enable when the request explicitly signals high risk (auth/security, migrations, destructive changes, production incidents, compliance/PII, public API breakage).

## Usage with interactive mode

```
$ralplan --interactive "task description"
```

## Behavior

## GPT-5.5 Guidance Alignment

Use the shared workflow guidance pattern: outcome-first framing, concise visible updates for multi-step planning, local overrides for the active workflow branch, evidence-backed planning and validation expectations, explicit stop rules, right-sized implementation/PRD shape, and automatic continuation for safe reversible steps. Ask only for material, destructive, credentialed, external-production, or preference-dependent branches.

This skill invokes the Plan skill in consensus mode:

```
$plan --consensus <arguments>
$plan --consensus --interactive <arguments>
```

The consensus workflow:
1. **Planner** creates an adaptive plan (right-sized to task scope; do not default to exactly five steps) and a compact **RALPLAN-DR summary** before review:
   - Principles (3-5)
   - Decision Drivers (top 3)
   - Viable Options (>=2) with bounded pros/cons
   - If only one viable option remains, explicit invalidation rationale for alternatives
   - Deliberate mode only: pre-mortem (3 scenarios) + expanded test plan (unit/integration/e2e/observability)
2. **User feedback** *(--interactive only)*: If `--interactive` is set, use the structured question UI (`omx question` in attached tmux; native structured input outside tmux when available) to present the draft plan **plus the Principles / Drivers / Options summary** before review (Proceed to review / Request changes / Skip review). Otherwise, automatically proceed to review.
3. **Architect** reviews for architectural soundness and must provide the strongest steelman antithesis, at least one real tradeoff tension, and (when possible) synthesis — **await completion before step 4**. In deliberate mode, Architect should explicitly flag principle violations.
4. **Critic** evaluates against quality criteria — run only after step 3 completes. Critic must enforce principle-option consistency, fair alternatives, risk mitigation clarity, testable acceptance criteria, and concrete verification steps. In deliberate mode, Critic must reject missing/weak pre-mortem or expanded test plan.
5. **Re-review loop** (max 5 iterations): Any non-`APPROVE` Critic verdict (`ITERATE` or `REJECT`) MUST run the same full closed loop:
   a. Collect Architect + Critic feedback
   b. Revise the plan with Planner
   c. Return to Architect review
   d. Return to Critic evaluation
   e. Repeat this loop until Critic returns `APPROVE` or 5 iterations are reached
   f. If 5 iterations are reached without `APPROVE`, present the best version to the user
6. On Critic approval *(--interactive only)*: If `--interactive` is set, use the structured question UI to present the plan with approval options (Approve and execute via ralph / Approve and implement via team / Request changes / Reject). Final plan must include ADR (Decision, Drivers, Alternatives considered, Why chosen, Consequences, Follow-ups), an explicit available-agent-types roster, concrete follow-up staffing guidance for both `ralph` and `team`, suggested reasoning levels by lane, explicit `omx team` / `$team` launch hints, and a concrete **team verification** path. Otherwise, output the final plan and stop.
7. *(--interactive only)* User chooses: Approve (ralph or team), Request changes, or Reject
8. *(--interactive only)* On approval: invoke `$ralph` for sequential execution or `$team` for parallel team execution with the explicit available-agent-types roster, reasoning-by-lane guidance, role/staffing allocation guidance, launch hints, and verification-path guidance from the approved plan -- never implement directly

> **Important:** Steps 3 and 4 MUST run sequentially. Do NOT issue both agent calls in the same parallel batch. Always await the Architect result before invoking Critic.

## Pre-context Intake

Before consensus planning or execution handoff, ground the plan in canonical artifacts:

1. Derive a task slug from the request.
2. Gather the smallest necessary brownfield facts before planning. When session guidance enables `USE_OMX_EXPLORE_CMD`, prefer `omx explore` for simple read-only repository lookups with narrow, concrete prompts; otherwise use the richer normal explore path.
3. If ambiguity remains high after fact-gathering, run `$deep-interview --quick <task>` before continuing.
4. If the plan depends on official docs, version-aware framework guidance, best practices, or external dependency behavior, auto-delegate `researcher` before finalizing the planning handoff so execution does not start from repo-local recall alone.
5. For planning-for-implementation, the final approved plan MUST create, refresh, or explicitly revalidate one typed context pack at `.omx/context/context-<timestamp>-<slug>.json` and record it in a `Context Pack Outcome` section.
6. Keep the role meanings crisp and fixed in v1: `scope` for boundary/guardrail refs, `build` for implementation refs, and `verify` for proof refs. Do not invent extra roles; use tags only for optional topical cross-cuts.
7. Reuse before rebuild: if the latest pack for the same slug still matches the approved PRD/test-spec and the refs remain sufficient, revalidate it instead of regenerating it. Refresh only the stale entries.
8. Keep typed packs compact and machine-checkable: schema `omx-context-pack-v1`, JSON-first, with `schema`, `slug`, tool-generated `basis`, and `entries`. Each entry is ref-first: `path` and `roles` required; `label`, `selector`, `relationPath`, and `tags` optional when the internal context-tool can infer them.
9. Build the smallest useful pack first: usually 3-6 total refs covering `scope`, `build`, and `verify`, but widen the pack whenever the approved slice genuinely needs more grounding. Prefer shared multi-role entries over duplicated refs.
10. Use the internal planning context-tool to generate or update packs instead of hand-crafting JSON when possible. Add a `selector` only when the source should be excerpted instead of loaded whole; short sources stay direct file refs. Let default relation paths follow `plan -> bounds/implements/verifies` unless a custom path is more informative.
11. Minimal pack creation loop: choose `context-<timestamp>-<slug>.json`, add the smallest useful refs, use pack `query` to inspect role/tag views without materializing excerpts, use `view` once to verify selectors and excerpt sizing, save the approved `prd-<timestamp>-<slug>.md` plus matching `test-spec-<timestamp>-<slug>.md`, record the exact pack path in `Context Pack Outcome`, then run pack `sync` once as the final handoff-ready gate. Legacy `prd-<slug>.md` / `test-spec-<slug>.md` remain readable.
12. Use pack `status` as the read-only diagnostic when readiness is unclear; it must report the canonical lifecycle state without refreshing `basis`, indexes, or excerpts.
13. Use tags only when they create a useful alternate view such as `auth`, `migration`, or `api-contract`. Tags are optional cross-cuts across roles, and multiple tag filters intersect. Do not mirror a role or label into tags.
14. `sync` is the final gate: it refreshes `basis`, rewrites the markdown index, and fails until the pack covers `scope`, `build`, and `verify` against the current approved PRD/test-spec including the `Context Pack Outcome`. If the PRD, test spec, or outcome section changes after sync, rerun sync before handoff.
15. The generated markdown sibling is human-facing index output only. The tool generates it from the JSON pack as a scaffold with the pack summary, role views, tag views, ref index, query/view hints, and one optional `View Notes` block. It includes derived facts such as role counts, tag counts, selector-backed entry counts, and direct-file entry counts so executors can scan the pack before querying it. Planners may extend only `View Notes` when concise notes add value, especially for tag-driven cross-cuts. It is not a second contract and must not turn into a second brief or carry embedded excerpts.

Do not hand off to execution modes until this intake is complete; if urgency forces progress, explicitly document the risk tradeoffs.

## Pre-Execution Gate

### Why the Gate Exists

Execution modes (ralph, autopilot, team, ultrawork) spin up heavy multi-agent orchestration. When launched on a vague request like "ralph improve the app", agents have no clear target — they waste cycles on scope discovery that should happen during planning, often delivering partial or misaligned work that requires rework.

The ralplan-first gate intercepts underspecified execution requests and redirects them through the ralplan consensus planning workflow. This ensures:
- **Explicit scope**: A PRD defines exactly what will be built
- **Test specification**: Acceptance criteria are testable before code is written
- **Execution context**: the approved plan points execution at the exact `.omx/context/context-<timestamp>-<slug>.json` pack to load first
- **Consensus**: Planner, Architect, and Critic agree on the approach
- **No wasted execution**: Agents start with a clear, bounded task

### Good vs Bad Prompts

**Passes the gate** (specific enough for direct execution):
- `ralph fix the null check in src/hooks/bridge.ts:326`
- `autopilot implement issue #42`
- `team add validation to function processKeywordDetector`
- `ralph do:\n1. Add input validation\n2. Write tests\n3. Update README`
- `ultrawork add the user model in src/models/user.ts`

**Gated — redirected to ralplan** (needs scoping first):
- `ralph fix this`
- `autopilot build the app`
- `team improve performance`
- `ralph add authentication`
- `ultrawork make it better`

**Bypass the gate** (when you know what you want):
- `force: ralph refactor the auth module`
- `! autopilot optimize everything`

### When the Gate Does NOT Trigger

The gate auto-passes when it detects **any** concrete signal. You do not need all of them — one is enough:

| Signal Type | Example prompt | Why it passes |
|---|---|---|
| File path | `ralph fix src/hooks/bridge.ts` | References a specific file |
| Issue/PR number | `ralph implement #42` | Has a concrete work item |
| camelCase symbol | `ralph fix processKeywordDetector` | Names a specific function |
| PascalCase symbol | `ralph update UserModel` | Names a specific class |
| snake_case symbol | `team fix user_model` | Names a specific identifier |
| Test runner | `ralph npm test && fix failures` | Has an explicit test target |
| Numbered steps | `ralph do:\n1. Add X\n2. Test Y` | Structured deliverables |
| Acceptance criteria | `ralph add login - acceptance criteria: ...` | Explicit success definition |
| Error reference | `ralph fix TypeError in auth` | Specific error to address |
| Code block | `ralph add: \`\`\`ts ... \`\`\`` | Concrete code provided |
| Escape prefix | `force: ralph do it` or `! ralph do it` | Explicit user override |

### End-to-End Flow Example

1. User types: `ralph add user authentication`
2. Gate detects: execution keyword (`ralph`) + underspecified prompt (no files, functions, or test spec)
3. Gate redirects to **ralplan** with message explaining the redirect
4. Ralplan consensus runs:
   - **Planner** creates initial plan (which files, what auth method, what tests)
   - **Architect** reviews for soundness
   - **Critic** validates quality and testability
5. On consensus approval, user chooses execution path:
   - **ralph**: sequential execution with verification
   - **team**: parallel coordinated agents
6. Execution begins with a clear, bounded plan

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Gate fires on a well-specified prompt | Add a file reference, function name, or issue number to anchor the request |
| Want to bypass the gate | Prefix with `force:` or `!` (e.g., `force: ralph fix it`) |
| Gate does not fire on a vague prompt | The gate only catches prompts with <=15 effective words and no concrete anchors; add more detail or use `$ralplan` explicitly |
| Redirected to ralplan but want to skip planning | In the ralplan workflow, say "just do it" or "skip planning" to transition directly to execution |

## Scenario Examples

**Good:** The user says `continue` after the workflow already has a clear next step. Continue the current branch of work instead of restarting or re-asking the same question.

**Good:** The user changes only the output shape or downstream delivery step (for example `make a PR`). Preserve earlier non-conflicting workflow constraints and apply the update locally.

**Bad:** The user says `continue`, and the workflow restarts discovery or stops before the missing verification/evidence is gathered.
